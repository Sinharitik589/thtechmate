Imagine the day when you are ordering online a <b>new Phone for your battery </b>instead of new battery. It will be of great fun right.<br/><br/>Nano diamond batteries, the technology that uses the diamond batteries concept or the nuclear battery concept. It is proposed to give 28000 years of battery backup.<br/><br/>The concept of "DIAMOND BATTERIES "proposed by the University of Bristol Cabot Institute during their annual lecture held on 25 November 2016 at the Wills Memorial Building.<br/> Theoretically it was said that , the battery will run on the radioactive waste of graphite blocks and will be able to deliver constant small current for thousands of years. It is named as diamond batteries, because it will use CARBON 14 , in the form of DIAMOND like carbon (DLC).<br/><br/>Since this claim, a lot of prototypes were proposed but none of them tried to put them in Market. <br/>But now a startup named <b>NANO DIAMOND BATTERIES [NDB] Inc. </b> claimed that they are going to make these batteries available commercially.<br/>That means, people will be able to use them in their cars or smartphones etc.</p>

                <p>Yes You heard it right, If NDB is able to make this battery available for comercial use. Definitely <b>you dont have to charge your phone</b> .As claimed the battery will give a backup of a huge 28000 thousands years. We dont know if the earth will exist then. After this revolution , You can do gaming, watching, surfing without any worry of charging. Nowdays the charging is the main priority of youths. There will be a day when you will say  - <I> "I really miss those days when I use to charge my phone " </I>  :P . </p>

                <p>With this nano diamond battery installed in cars <b>we dont have to charge our cars</b> . There is no need of charging station then, which is a big problem in the ELECTRIC VEHICLE Revolution. After this the Electric vehicle revolution will be easy , if NDB can provide the nano diamond batteries in possible budget. With use of Electric vehicle , there will be less pollution, less demand of reserved minerals, And that will lead to sustainable development.</p>
